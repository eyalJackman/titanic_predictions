# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict the survival rate of passengers aboard the Titanic using the Kaggle dataset. 

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset provided by Kaggle. Information includes age, sex, ticket class, and whether they survived or not. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Dependencies

This project uses several Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Results

After training the model, the accuracy achieved on the test set is approximately 80%, indicating that the model can predict survival with a reasonably high accuracy.
